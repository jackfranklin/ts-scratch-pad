# ts-scratch-pad

A small repo that I use as a template whenever I need to quickly play with some code locally.

It uses TypeScript (although no reason you couldn't use `.js` files), Prettier and ts-node.

Once you've grabbed this repo and written some code you can easily execute it:

```
npx ts-node src/app.ts
```
